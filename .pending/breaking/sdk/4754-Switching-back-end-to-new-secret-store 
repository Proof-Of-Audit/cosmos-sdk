#4754 Switching back-end to new secret store using library [Keyring](https://github.com/99designs/keyring)
  * This is intended to provide stronger security guarantees by using the OS built-in secret store instead of the legacy key database which was designed to single user computers. 
  * Security audit recommendation was to use the OS secret store. 
  * Existing users are expected to migrate their keys using the migrate command:
    * `gaiacli keys migrate`
  * Support for legacay keystore is available through the secret store flag:
    * `gaiacli keys add <key_name> --legacy` 
  * Signing transactions is allowed on the legacy store if you pass in the legacy secret store flag
  * Running the tests locally may require entering your user password to access your keystore large amount of times (if anyone has a workaround, please leave a comment, thanks)
